// 1. Choose an element called "the pivot", how that's done is up to the implementation.
// 2. Take two variables to point left and right of the list excluding pivot.
// 3. Left points to the low index.
// 4. Right points to the high index.
// 5. While value at left is less than pivot move right.
// 6. While value at right is greater than pivot move left.
// 7. If both step 5 and step 6 does not match, swap left and right.
// 8. If left â‰¥ right, the point where they met is new pivot.
// 9. Repeat, recursively calling this for smaller and smaller arrays.
